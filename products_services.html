      <img src="_images/soaps_3.jpg" alt="Tigerwood Armchair image placeholder" />
      <p>
        Commanding presence meets comfort. This armchair blends the raw strength of tiger-like patterns carved into rich wood with plush cream cushions. Its broad,
        sculptural arms make it not just a seat but a throne for modern living spaces. A piece that roars with personality while holding onto elegance.

     <img src="_images/soaps_4.jpg" alt="Twin Tiger Set image placeholder" />
      <p>
        Designed for both intimacy and drama, this set of two tiger-patterned chairs with a matching ottoman is perfect for conversational corners. The deep wood
        frame grounds the design, while the fabric evokes the wild beauty of untamed landscapes. Luxurious, yet inviting — a pair that turns any room into a private lounge.

      <p>
        This rounded armchair embodies softness and strength in perfect balance. Covered in creamy fur-like upholstery with subtle animal markings, it feels like a blend
        of modern luxury and primal design. The deep seat invites relaxation, while the bold shape makes it a sculptural centerpiece.

      <p>
        For the outdoors but designed like art. These lounge chairs carry the same bold tiger-print design as the twin indoor set, but reimagined for open-air living.
        Built for relaxation under the sun, they celebrate nature with patterns that honor the wild — making your garden or patio an extension of luxury.
